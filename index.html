            <p>Fall 2019 - Spring 2020</p>
            <p>The original aim of this project was to design and build a robot capable of autonomous payload retrieval and delivery within a hallway. 
              Although it was stopped short due to COVID-19 ending my senior year, this project had many successes such as creating a 
              Robot Operating System (ROS) compatible electro-mechanical design capable of teleoperation, preliminary 
              environment mapping, PID motor control, fusion of inertial measurement unit data, and even encoder odometry.

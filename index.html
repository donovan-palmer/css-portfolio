        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <img src="images/robotics/cara-actual.jpg" alt="=Senior Capstone -- Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle">
        <p>The original aim of this project was to design and build a robot capable of autonomous payload retrieval and delivery within a hallway. Although it was 
          stopped short due to COVID-19 ending my senior year, this project had many successes such as creating a Robot Operating System (ROS) compatible electro-mechanical design capable of teleoperation, preliminary 
          environment mapping, PID motor control, fusion of inertial measurement unit data, and even encoder odometry.
